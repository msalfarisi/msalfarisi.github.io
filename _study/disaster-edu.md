In our life, we can't ensure our safety, and thus, we need to be aware of what kind of risk that surrounds us. To increase people awareness about disaster risk and how to respond during disaster, we are developing a so called "Disaster Mitigation Action Card" game. People often feel lazy to study or explore by themselves, however, this game enables education by playing, unconsciously. This game is designed as understandable as for elementary school student level. About the game, more information can be obtained from [here](http://g-safety.tohoku.ac.jp/en/dmac/). Furthermore, we also performed education for disaster mitigation utilizing science experiments.
